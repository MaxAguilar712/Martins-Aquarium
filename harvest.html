         <b>ATLANTIC OCEAN DIVE SITE:   VICTORY REEF, BIMINI:  This is where I found Murray the Moray Eel!!! </b> <p>_________________</p>  South and west of Grand Bahama are the ‘Islands in the Stream,’ better known as Bimini, made up of north and south islands. Bimini sits right on the edge of the Gulf Stream, which runs between the Bahamas and the east coast of Florida. Victory Reef just off Cat Cay, south of Bimini, is a 5-mile strip of reef line offering several dive spots ranging from 30 to 80 feet (9 to 24 m), thus appropriate for many experience levels. Because of the Gulf Stream location, divers can expect to see a large variety of marine life. From larger species like turtles, sharks and rays, to the vibrant reef fish that cover the corals, sponges and fans, there’s plenty of activity to keep divers busy. Visibility can be great here too, up to 100 feet (30 m).  There are also swim-throughs, small caverns and exaggerated reef structures to explore. Three of the best spots are Cathedral, Sponge Garden and Rainbow Valley.

        <b>PACIFIC OCEAN DIVE SITE:   TRUK LAGOON, MICRONESIA:  This is where I found Bob the Blobfish!!! </b>  <p>_________________</p>  Though known for its amazing wreck diving, Truk Lagoon is surrounded by a barrier reef. You can see corals of all shapes and colors, plus what is even more amazing, most of the wrecks are covered in soft coral. Even if wreck diving is not your favorite, it is full of beautiful coral and it is amazing to see tropical fish swimming around tanks, bicycles, trucks, torpedos, airplane parts, and much more.

        The lagoon offers dive sites for every level of scuba diver. You can find shallower wrecks to dive at or there are also options for exploring deep inside various wrecks. Marine life enthusiasts will be captivated by all the marine life that the soft corals on wrecks have attracted. You can see plenty of macro objects like nudibranch and anemones or even larger animals like reef sharks. The dive conditions are great with warm waters all year round and very little current inside the lagoon that makes the dives relatively easy.

    <b>ANTARCTIC OCEAN DIVE SITE:   ANTARCTIC PENINSULA, ANTARCTICA:  This is where I found Angela the Anglerfish </b> <p>_________________</p>  Before departure you will need to show an internationally accepted diving certificate, diver's logbook and a statement from your doctor (not older than two years) stating that you are physically healthy to practice scuba diving. This may seem a little excessive, but so far from a proper hospital and medical care, safety is of the utmost priority.
    The voyage will start with a check-dive so all divers can get used to the cold water and try out their equipment and the number of weights they need. Before each dive, there will be a briefing about the location of the site, the weather and ice conditions and the procedure of the dive.
    The dive sites will vary from shallow ice diving, diving along a wall, from a beach or from the zodiac. The maximum depth is around 60 feet/ 20 meters.

        <b>SOUTH AUSTRALIA DIVE SITE:   FLEURIEU PENINSULA, AUSTRALIA:  This is where I found Hammy the Handfish!!! </b> <p>_________________</p>  Many of South Australia’s dive sites are accessible as easy shore dives, offering great diving and the opportunity to spot the leafy seadragon – a creature found nowhere else in the world. Spot them on a diving trip on the Fleurieu Peninsula, and further afield in Edithburgh and Port Hughes Jetty. For a deeper dive, head out to the Glenelg Dredge and Glenelg Barge wrecks with Adelaide Scuba, or visit the Glenelg tyre reef which was set up in 1983 as a fish breeding ground.

        <b>INDIAN OCEAN DIVE SITE:   ST. LEU, REUNION ISLAND:  This is where I found Tammy the Telescopefish!!! </b> <p>_________________</p> A diving holiday in St Leu, Reunion Island, allows you to explore the wreck of Antonio Lorenzo, a longliner that flew the Chilean flag. This vessel was boarded on 1 September 1998 by the French vessel Albatros while on patrol at sea. The captain of the Albatros discovered the two longliners Ercilla and Antonio Lorenzo fishing illegally. One of them, the Antonio Lorenzo, had 100 tonnes of toothfish or Dissostichus eleginoides, a carnivorous fish found in the southern seas, in its holds. This fish is caught at depths of up to 2,000 meters. Although longlining is the only fishing method authorized by the French Southern and Antarctic Lands Administrator (TAAF), nevertheless, the practice of trawling predominates.

        <b>MALAYSIAN DIVE SITE:   LANG TANGAH, MALAYSIA:  This is where I found Betty the Betta Fish!!! </b>  <p>_________________</p>  Located between the islands of Redang and Perhentian, the smaller, and lesser-known island of Lang Tengah offers great diving opportunities. The diverse and colourful reefs offer encounters with turtles, resident schools of jacks, barracudas and leopard sharks. Lang Tengah’s generally easy conditions make diving here suitable for all levels, including beginners.
